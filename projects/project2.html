        &emsp; This project is inspired by the amazing works created by the Gee's Bend Quilt makers. 
        Their works are asymmetrical in nature but have an air of symmetry. I wanted my work to be conveyed in a similar way. 
        Most of all I wanted my project to be pleasing to view, so I focused on ways to keep the colors of my piece both stimulating, 
        but not too much. I also wanted the piece to be interactive in a way that the viewer could generate new iterations from it without 
        each piece feeling repetitive but have each work related to the last. 
        <br>
        &emsp; Each time the user clicks on any location of the screen a new 
        piece will be generated. Each generated work consists of a solid background with a color chosen from the full R,G,B spectrum, then 
        it is layered with shapes ranging from rectangular to circular each separately colored by one of five colors I thought were pleasing plus 
        the option of absolute black or white. How the shapes are placed is determined iteratively with included noise and randomness. 
        Some pieces will have larger more oriented structures were other generations will be overlapping and cluttered but in a pleasing way. 
        Then a border is placed over the piece to segment the quilt into quadrants, this border is on a small random blue spectrum, and 
        it is embroidered with random shapes of a full color spectrum but on the darker side.
