        &emsp; “In past times when one lived in contact with nature, abstraction was easy; it was done unconsciously. 
        Now in our denaturalized age abstraction becomes an effort.”- Piet Mondrian
        <br>
        &emsp; With this quote in mind, I wanted to generate art most similar to his more famous work 
        “Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow, 1930”. As he states in his quote above it is not merely 
        lines and colors on a canvas, it is what we can get from their harmony and what emotion or thoughts they can generate inside of us.
        <br>
        &emsp; I wanted to create a sense of unity in my work in the same way Mondrian did in his composition, while also having 
        my work being randomly created each time. So, I structured my code in a way that used only black, blue, red, yellow, and white. 
        Each rectangle does not offset its surrounding rectangles in a way that looks disjointed but instead complements its neighbor’s dynamic structures.
        <br>
        &emsp; I added a slight random variation in the temperature of each color to give each composition a feeling of depth. I like this effect, 
        and it is one of the last things I added to the project. When I stare at some of the works generated it has a interesting effect on my eyes, 
        like the room is getting darker.
